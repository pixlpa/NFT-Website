# NFT Front End

### **Welcome ðŸ‘‹**
This is just a react+ethers front end for minting NFTs

1. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
2. Run `npm run start` to start the project
3. Add your contract addresses, links, images, etc. in src/App.js
4. Add your exported contract json file to "utils" and update the import in WalletUi.jsx (will not compile without this)
5. Check the price in App.js
6. Customize Metadata in public/index.html
